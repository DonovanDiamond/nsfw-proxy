#### Command Line AI Classifier

This project allow you to decide which AI tool to use for classify your content. The one I personally use by its speed and low cost on memory is BONK, and it is the only one supported currently by the project. If you know one that you want to be supported on the project please leave it as an issue and I will check it.

Here are classified the **supported** CLI AI Classifier tools. They have a tag called Installing Difficulty what will indicate if you need or not technical knowledge to install it:

- **HARD**: You will need to know about git and the programming language that it is developed. Probably will be different to install it on windows, linux or mac.
- **MEDIUM**: To install it you will need to read a documentation and follow different steps for your operative system.
- **EASY**: You only download it and click continue, continue, accept, continue, finish. (Or install it in your dependency manager if you're on linux)
